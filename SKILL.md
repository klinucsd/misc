# d3d-elm-index -- stored ELM labels and filterscope availability

## What this is

A local SQLite index of ELM labels produced by running detection code over
DIII-D shots, plus a record of what filterscope data each shot actually had.

Three kinds of stored fact, and anything derivable from them is in scope:

1. **ELM labels** -- when a shot was ELMy (phases) and when individual ELMs
   fired (bursts), in milliseconds.
2. **Detector provenance** -- which method, version and parameters produced
   each label, so results from different methods can be compared instead of
   silently mixed.
3. **Signal availability** -- which filterscope channels a shot has, at what
   sampling rate, and the reason when a channel is missing.

This is not a fixed list of supported questions. Compose the functions below,
and use `query_elm_index(sql)` with `schema()` for anything they do not cover.

## What this is NOT

- **Not the raw waveform.** To fetch and plot a D-alpha trace, use
  `d3d-filterscopes` or `d3d-shot-fetcher`.
- **Not shot metadata.** For kappa, Ip, beam power, pulse length or the signal
  catalog, use `d3d-relational-db`. To combine the two, see "Joining to
  d3drdb" below.
- **Not a live detector.** These are labels from a past run. Producing new
  labels is a separate offline job.

## No fdp wrapper needed

Local SQLite -- no network, no Pelican, no `fdp`. Run scripts with plain
`python script.py`. The command must be BARE `python script.py`, with no
`cd ... &&`, no pipes and no redirection, so it runs in-kernel.

## Importing

```python
import os, sys
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.expanduser("~/.deepagents/agent/skills/d3d-elm-index"))
from d3d_elm_index import (
    elm_index_info, schema, runs, query_elm_index,
    is_indexed, shot_status, elm_windows, elm_bursts, was_elmy_at,
    elm_statistics, find_shots,
    signal_availability, shots_with_signals, coverage_summary,
    compare_runs, ShotNotIndexed,
    # ground truth and cross-method comparison (rules 9 and 10)
    label_sets, regime_windows, regime_at, compare_on_shot, plot_comparison,
    shots_with_multiple_sources,
)
```

## The ten rules, in one place

Read the rule that applies before answering. Each is spelled out below.

1. **Absence is not evidence of absence** -- a shot not in the index was not
   analysed; that is not "no ELMs".
2. **Never compare counts across granularity** -- an `interval` row is an ELMy
   phase, a `burst` row is one ELM.
3. **Check coverage before quoting a proportion** -- the index is a non-uniform
   subset, not a census.
4. **Report a detector's parameters, never guess its algorithm** -- the code is
   not in this image.
5. **A `labeled` status does NOT mean the discharge was ELMy** -- it means
   D-alpha transients were detected. Never report a fraction of shots that
   "are ELMy".
6. **Check `signal_snr`** -- it is dB and can be negative; the detector picks
   the best available channel, not a good one.
7. **Every time is milliseconds** -- 0-6000 is 6 seconds.
8. **When the index falls short, offer a fetch with a cost** -- do not stop at
   "unknown", and do not fetch unprompted.
9. **The index holds ground truth as well as detector output** -- never present
   a hand-labelled run as a detector result, or vice versa. Call
   `label_sets()`.
10. **Never compare an ELM-event run against a regime-window run** -- same
    granularity, different kind of statement. And clip to the comparable
    window: ground-truth runs cover only the slice a person labelled.

Rules 9 and 10 are spelled out first because they concern the most recently
added data and are the easiest to get silently wrong; rules 1-8 follow.

## Before those: how to talk to the person asking

The user does not work on this system. They are a fusion scientist asking
about DIII-D. Two habits matter.

**Never make them supply a shot number they have no way to know.** "Find a
shot where several methods can be compared" is a normal question and it has an
answer -- `shots_with_multiple_sources()`. Never answer a question of that
shape with "which shot?".

```python
X.shots_with_multiple_sources(min_sources=4)
# [{'shot': 163518, 'n_sources': 4,
#   'methods': ['human_elm_events', 'human_regime', 'omfit_elm', 'slope_outlier'],
#   'ground_truth': ['human_elm_events', 'human_regime'], 'has_expert_labels': True}]
X.shots_with_multiple_sources(min_sources=3)          # 23 shots
X.shots_with_multiple_sources(min_sources=2, require_ground_truth=True)   # 342 shots
```

**Never use our internal vocabulary in an answer.** These are implementation
words. Translate:

| do not say | say |
|---|---|
| "the ELM index" / "the database" | "DIII-D shot data" -- or just answer |
| "run 4" | "the labels hand-made by a DIII-D expert" |
| "run 2" / "slope_outlier" | "GA's mode_classifier detector" |
| "omfit_elm" | "the OMFIT detector" |
| "granularity burst / interval" | "individual ELMs" / "ELMy phases" |
| "human_regime windows" | "the expert's confinement-regime labels" |
| "none_found vs no_data" | "the detector ran and found nothing" vs "the data isn't there" |

Name a run_id only when the person asks how something was produced, or when
two runs would otherwise be ambiguous. Provenance still matters -- say which
detector and which settings produced a number -- but say it in words a
scientist uses.

## Rule 9: the index holds ground truth, not just detector output

Some runs are hand-labelled by a domain expert. They are the yardstick, not
another opinion. `label_sets()` says which is which:

```python
X.label_sets()["runs"]
# run 1  slope_outlier     interval  elm_events      10820 shots  detector      [default]
# run 2  slope_outlier     burst     elm_events      10820 shots  detector      [default]
# run 3  human_regime      interval  regime_windows    397 shots  GROUND TRUTH
# run 4  human_elm_events  burst     elm_events         23 shots  GROUND TRUTH
# run 5  omfit_elm         burst     elm_events         23 shots  detector
# run 6  slope_outlier     burst     elm_events         23 shots  detector
```

Ground-truth runs are **scoped**: they cover only the shots and time windows a
person actually labelled. Outside that scope they assert nothing -- absence is
Rule 1 again, more sharply.

Runs 1 and 2 are the blessed defaults. There is no implicit fallback: a query
with no `run_id` uses the blessed run or raises. It never silently picks the
newest, which would have quietly narrowed every answer to 23 shots once these
comparison runs were added.

## Rule 10: kind, not just granularity -- and clip the window

A run's `granularity` says how finely it cuts time. It does **not** say what
the labels mean:

| kind | a row asserts | example run |
|---|---|---|
| `elm_events` | "an ELM occurred at t" | 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 |
| `regime_windows` | "the plasma was in QH-mode from t1 to t2" | 3 |

Runs 1 and 3 are both `interval`. Differencing them yields a number that looks
fine and means nothing. Use `compare_on_shot()`, which refuses across kinds and
clips to the intersection of the runs' analysis windows -- one graded window in
the answer key is 17 ms, so an unclipped whole-shot run would appear to have
hundreds of "extra" events it never claimed were in that window.

```python
X.compare_on_shot(154749)
# comparable_window_ms: [2548.0, 3362.0]
# run 4  human_elm_events  ground truth  15 events  labeled
# run 5  omfit_elm         detector      14 events  labeled
# run 6  slope_outlier     detector      14 events  labeled

X.compare_on_shot(180445)      # a no-plasma control shot
# run 4  human_elm_events  ground truth    0 events  none_found
# run 5  omfit_elm         detector        0 events  error
# run 6  slope_outlier     detector      372 events  labeled
# warning: ... Zero-because-it-crashed is not zero-because-it-found-nothing;
#          do not read it as agreement with a ground truth of 0.
```

**Report a crashed detector's zero as a failure, never as agreement.**

Regime context, when the shot has it:

```python
X.regime_windows(163518)[:2]
# [{'start_ms': 0.0, 'end_ms': 8.0, 'regime': 'ELMy H',
#   'means': 'ELMing H-mode -- the plasma IS producing ELMs'},
#  {'start_ms': 1100.0, 'end_ms': 1820.0, 'regime': 'QH',
#   'means': 'Quiescent H-mode -- good confinement, no ELMs, edge oscillates instead'}]
X.regime_at(163518, 3000)
# {'start_ms': 2480.0, 'end_ms': 5000.0, 'regime': 'WPQH', 'means': 'Wide-Pedestal Quiescent H-mode'}
```

### Plotting a comparison

**When asked to show, plot or visualise how methods differ, call
`plot_comparison(shot)` and present its figure as the answer.**

```python
ax = X.plot_comparison(163518)          # returns a matplotlib Axes
```

It is already the complete comparison figure: each method on its own track,
every event coloured by the regime it falls in, the quiescent count per method
in the row label, a crashed detector marked as crashed, duplicate runs hidden,
and granularities kept apart. A figure assembled by hand has to get all of
that right; one attempt shaded the band labelled "ELMs expected" across the
quiescent stretch, asserting the opposite of its own conclusion.

**To change the size, pass `figsize` to the call:**

```python
X.plot_comparison(163518, figsize=(14, None))   # wider, height stays automatic
X.plot_comparison(163518, figsize=(14, 6))      # both fixed
```

The figure sets its own height from the number of label sets, roughly 0.6 inch
per row. Resizing it afterwards with `fig.set_size_inches()` leaves the rows at
their data coordinates and turns the extra height into blank space between
them.

**To show whether a detector fires during quiescent periods on a given shot,
call `plot_comparison(shot)`** -- the hand-labelled regime background and the
per-row "n in quiescent" count answer that question directly, for any shot with
regime labels, whether or not a second detector or expert ELM list exists.

**To add a view the function does not provide, pass `ax=` and draw onto the
same axes**, so the answer carries one figure rather than two that can
disagree about the same shot.

Pass `dalpha={'times':..., 'data':...}` from d3d-filterscopes to overlay the
waveform the detectors looked at; without it the tracks still render, since
this skill must not require the network. `run_ids=` chooses which sets appear.

### Reporting how often a method failed

**Read `n_failed` from `label_sets()`** -- it counts shots with status
`error`. A count of zero-event shots would merge a crash with an honest "ran
and found nothing", which are different claims about the machine:

Each row of `label_sets()['runs']` carries: `run_id`, `method`, `granularity`,
`kind`, `source`, `is_ground_truth`, `shots`, `status_counts`, `n_failed`,
`n_ran_and_found_nothing`, `is_default`, `notes`.

```python
{r['method']: (r['n_failed'], r['n_ran_and_found_nothing'])
 for r in X.label_sets()['runs']}
# {'slope_outlier': (313, 119), 'human_regime': (0, 0),
#  'human_elm_events': (0, 6), 'omfit_elm': (4, 4)}
# omfit_elm: 4 crashed, 4 ran and found nothing -- NOT '8 failures'.
```

## Rule 1: absence is not evidence of absence

This is the single most important thing about this index and the easiest error
to make.

The index covers **a subset of the archive that grows over time**. A shot that
is not in it has *not been analysed*. That is completely different from a shot
that was analysed and found to have no ELMs.

Functions raise `ShotNotIndexed` rather than returning an empty list, so this
cannot be missed by accident:

```python
elm_windows(999)
# ShotNotIndexed: shot 999 is not in the ELM index -- it has not been analysed.
```

**`shot_status(N)` returns a LIST -- one row per run, not a single verdict.**
A shot has a status per method, and they differ: a detector can crash on the
same shot where an expert found nothing.

```python
X.shot_status(163518)          # 5 rows, one per run
# [{'run_id': 1, 'method': 'slope_outlier', 'granularity': 'interval',
#   'status': 'labeled', 'n_labels': 6, ...},
#  {'run_id': 2, 'method': 'slope_outlier', 'granularity': 'burst',
#   'status': 'labeled', 'n_labels': 91, ...}, ...]
# row keys: run_id, method, granularity, status, signal_used, signal_snr,
#           t_start, t_end, n_labels, error
```

Report "shot N has no ELMs" only for a run whose row says `none_found`, and say
which method it was.

The same distinction applies within an analysed shot. `elm_run_shots.status`:

| status | meaning |
|---|---|
| `labeled` | analysed, ELMs found |
| `none_found` | analysed, genuinely no ELMs |
| `no_data` | the signal could not be fetched (reason in `error`) |
| `error` | data returned but unusable by this detector (reason in `error`) |

## Rule 2: never compare across granularity

The same detector produces two different products depending on one parameter:

- **`interval`** -- one row per continuous **ELMy phase** (many ELMs).
- **`burst`** -- one row per **individual ELM**.

An interval count and a burst count are not comparable. For shot 149058 the
same detector gives 2 interval rows and 82 burst rows. Use `elm_windows()` for
phases and `elm_bursts()` for individual ELMs; `compare_runs()` refuses to
difference two runs of differing granularity and returns a warning instead.

## Rule 3: check what is in the index before quoting a proportion

Call `elm_index_info()` first. It returns coverage, status counts, the label
classes actually present, and caveats. Two traps it exposes:

- The indexed shots are **not a uniform sample**. The index is built in batches
  with different sampling strategies -- an even stride, a validation set, and
  contiguous blocks -- so percentages over the whole index are skewed. The
  caveat returned by `elm_index_info()` is **computed from the data**, so it
  describes the current composition rather than a fixed description that goes
  stale. Use `coverage_summary()` to see the distribution, and restrict to a
  known-unbiased shot list for an archive-representative figure.
- Only the label classes listed in `label_classes` are produced. If `QH` is
  absent, that means **this detector does not emit it**, not that no shot was
  ever in QH mode.

Real output (the index grows, so read the live values rather than these):

```python
info = elm_index_info()
# shots_indexed: 10820
# shot_range: (55102, 207503)
# status_counts: {'labeled': 9532, 'no_data': 856, 'error': 313, 'none_found': 119}
# labels: {'run 1 (interval)': 26178, 'run 2 (burst)': 1314843}
# label_classes: ['ELMy H']
# channels_tracked: ['fs03da', 'fs04', 'fs04da', 'fs05da']
# low_snr_labeled_shots: 653
```

## Rule 4: report a detector's PARAMETERS, never guess its ALGORITHM

`parameters` tells you `pos_deriv_thresh = 2.7` and
`lowpass_cutoff_freq = 2000.0`. It does **not** tell you what that threshold is
normalised against, how the baseline is estimated, or in what order the steps
run. The algorithm lives in the source repository, which is **not installed in
this image** -- you cannot read it from here.

So when asked what a detector *does*: give the method name, version, commit,
repo and the full parameter set, and say the internals must be read from that
repo. Do **not** reconstruct the mechanism from parameter names.

Two plausible inventions have already reached a reviewer this way:

| invented | actual |
|---|---|
| thresholds are "MAD-normalised" | the reference detector fits a **gamma** distribution; MAD appears nowhere in it |
| the code is "legacy Python 2" | it is **Python 3**; the compatibility patch was for a pandas 2 / toksearch 2.x API change |

Both were stated confidently and both were wrong. "The parameters are X; the
algorithm is documented at <repo>@<commit>" is the complete, correct answer.

## Rule 5: `labeled` does not mean the discharge was ELMy

This is the most important limitation of the label set, and the one most likely
to produce a confident wrong answer.

`status = 'labeled'` means **the detector found D-alpha transients**. It does
not mean the discharge was in ELMy H-mode. The detector almost never declines:
`none_found` is a small fraction of a percent of analysed shots.

Validation confirms this is over-labelling, not physics. Run against discharges
that domain experts hand-labelled as QH-mode -- a regime that by definition has
no ELMs -- the detector labelled **every single one**. QH-mode carries edge
harmonic oscillations and real D-alpha activity, and a slope threshold responds
to it.

**Therefore, the correct answer to "what fraction of DIII-D shots are ELMy?"
is that this index cannot answer it.** Not "98.8% of analysed shots", not any
figure with caveats attached. The label is not an ELMy/not-ELMy classification,
so no denominator rescues it. Say so plainly, and say why: the detector labels
essentially everything with a usable D-alpha trace.

The same applies to any question of the form "how many / what proportion of
shots are ELMy", "is shot N an ELMy discharge", or "find me the non-ELMy
shots".

**Magnitude carries the signal; the binary does not.** Burst count and total
ELMy duration separate regimes far better than the presence of a label -- QH
discharges score markedly lower on both than the index at large, though the
distributions overlap and no clean threshold exists. When a question is really
about ELM behaviour, use `elm_statistics()` and compare magnitudes rather than
counting labelled shots.

## Working examples (all verified against the real index)

### One shot: everything known about it

```python
elm_statistics(149058)
# {'shot': 149058, 'n_windows': 2, 'n_bursts': 82,
#  'elmy_duration_ms': 3595.04, 'first_elm_ms': 65.46, 'last_elm_ms': 5121.84,
#  'frequency_hz': 22.81, 'mean_period_ms': 43.84, 'mean_burst_ms': 5.41,
#  'signal_used': 'fs04da', 'status': 'labeled'}
```

`frequency_hz` is bursts divided by ELMy duration -- the rate *while ELMing*,
not averaged over the whole discharge.

### ELMy phases, and individual ELMs inside a time window

```python
elm_windows(149058)
# [{'start_time': 65.46, 'end_time': 97.02, 'duration_ms': 31.56,
#   'label': 'ELMy H', 'confidence': None, 'run_id': 1}, ...]   # 2 rows

elm_bursts(149058, 2000, 2200)
# [{'start_time': 2017.86, 'end_time': 2025.30, 'duration_ms': 7.44,
#   'label': 'ELMy H'}, ...]                                    # 4 rows
```

### Point query: was the plasma ELMy at this instant?

```python
was_elmy_at(149058, 3000)
# {'start_time': 1558.36, 'end_time': 5121.84, 'label': 'ELMy H'}
was_elmy_at(149058, 200)
# None
```

`None` means no ELMy phase covers that time. It does **not** mean L-mode -- the
quiet period could be ELM-suppressed H-mode or QH-mode, which this detector
does not distinguish.

### Finding shots by ELM behaviour

`find_shots()` takes any combination of criteria, ANDed together:

```python
find_shots(min_elmy_ms=4000, limit=3)
# [{'shot': 142183, 'status': 'labeled', 'signal_used': 'fs04da',
#   'signal_snr': 25.04, 'n_windows': 2, 'elmy_ms': 5084.2, 'n_bursts': 245}, ...]

find_shots(shot_min=200000, signal_used='fs03da')     # by channel and era
find_shots(min_bursts=300)                            # heavily ELMing shots
find_shots(status='error')                            # data-quality triage
```

Available criteria: `shot_min`, `shot_max`, `status`, `signal_used`,
`min_windows`, `min_elmy_ms`, `max_elmy_ms`, `min_bursts`, `label`, `limit`.

### Which channel produced the label, and why it matters

The detector ranks candidate channels by signal-to-noise **per shot**, so the
diagnostic varies within one run. Always report `signal_used` when comparing
shots -- a difference between two shots may come from the channel, not the
plasma.

```python
query_elm_index("""SELECT signal_used, COUNT(*) n FROM elm_run_shots
                   WHERE run_id = 1 AND signal_used IS NOT NULL
                   GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY n DESC""")
# [{'signal_used': 'fs04da', 'n': 430}, {'signal_used': 'fs03da', 'n': 95},
#  {'signal_used': 'fs05da', 'n': 38}]
```

Note this aggregate is skewed by the index's non-uniform sampling (Rule 3), and
the preferred channel also drifts with shot era.

### Rule 6: check `signal_snr` before trusting a shot's labels

`signal_snr` is in **dB and can be negative**. The detector picks the *best
available* channel, not a *good* one, and labels the shot regardless. In the
current index **20 labelled shots have negative SNR** -- noise exceeding
signal (`elm_index_info()['low_snr_labeled_shots']`):

```python
query_elm_index("""SELECT shot, ROUND(signal_snr,1) snr, signal_used, n_labels
                   FROM elm_run_shots WHERE run_id = 1 AND signal_snr < 0
                   ORDER BY signal_snr LIMIT 3""")
# [{'shot': 192179, 'snr': -10.5, 'signal_used': 'fs04da', 'n_labels': 7},
#  {'shot': 188421, 'snr': -9.3,  'signal_used': 'fs05da', 'n_labels': 1},
#  {'shot': 183857, 'snr': -8.2,  'signal_used': 'fs05da', 'n_labels': 2}]
```

Shot 188421 has 443 burst labels from a -9.3 dB channel. Those labels exist,
but presenting them as a confident measurement would be wrong. Flag low SNR
when reporting per-shot results, and consider excluding `signal_snr < 0` from
aggregate statistics.

`signal_snr` can also be `inf` (a channel with no measurable noise); guard
against it in arithmetic.

### Rule 7: every time in this index is in MILLISECONDS

`start_time`, `end_time`, `t_start`, `t_end`, `elmy_duration_ms`,
`first_elm_ms` -- all milliseconds. A full discharge runs 0 to ~6000, which is
**6 seconds, not 6000 seconds**. Labelling those as seconds is a 1000x error
and it has actually happened in review. Derived rates are Hz, and `rate_khz` is
kHz.

When you print a time, put `ms` in the column header.

## Rule 8: when the index falls short, OFFER a fetch -- do not just say "unknown"

The index is a cache over a much larger archive. When a question needs a shot
it does not cover, "not indexed" is a true but unhelpful answer. The raw data
usually **is** reachable from Pelican.

The required behaviour, in order:

1. Say what the index knows.
2. **Run `fetch_estimate()` and put its numbers in your answer** -- the actual
   gigabytes and minutes, written out.
3. Ask whether to proceed, and wait.

Step 2 is the one that gets skipped. "I can run a fetch estimate, just say the
word" is **not** an acceptable answer: it offers to do arithmetic instead of
doing it, and leaves the user unable to decide. Nor is a large number a reason
to withhold it -- "completing this range means ~108 GB and about 80 minutes"
is exactly what lets someone say "no, do a narrower slice". Silence about the
cost is worse than a big number.

Do not fetch unprompted -- fetching is slow and metered, and the user may not
want it. But always price it.

Use `fetch_estimate()` so the numbers are measured, not guessed:

```python
fetch_estimate(186000)
# {'requested': 1, 'already_indexed': [], 'would_fetch': [186000],
#  'megabytes': 31.0, 'seconds': 1.4, 'seconds_8_workers': 0.9,
#  'megabytes_note': '31.0 MB/shot crosses the wire; only 9.6 MB/shot is
#                     decoded and used',
#  'likely_no_data': [], 'can_answer_by_fetching': [...], ...}

fetch_estimate(range(200000, 200020))
# 20 shots -> 620.0 MB, ~28 s serial (~18 s with 8 workers)
```

It also flags shots below the filterscope coverage boundary (shot 130882) as
`likely_no_data` — cheap misses at ~0.65 s and no payload — so a wide old range
is not over-quoted.

**Quote `megabytes` as the transfer cost, not the array size.** Reading four
channels pulls whole tree files, so ~31 MB crosses the wire per shot while only
~9.6 MB is decoded. Using the array figure understates transfer threefold.

**Be precise about what a fetch would and would not settle**, because the two
differ here:

| Fetching CAN answer | Fetching CANNOT answer |
|---|---|
| which channels exist for the shot | ELM labels from GA's detector |
| sampling rate and time coverage | when the shot was ELMy |
| the raw D-alpha trace (plot it, count peaks) | anything requiring the stored label set |

GA's `mode_classifier` is **not installed in this image**, so new ELM labels
cannot be produced here. Offering to "detect the ELMs" for an un-indexed shot
would be a promise the environment cannot keep. Fetching the trace and plotting
it, so the user can see the ELM spikes, is honest and often enough.

A good response to "how many ELMs in shot 186000?" therefore looks like:

> Shot 186000 has not been analysed, so the index has no count -- and that is
> not evidence it had none. I can fetch its D-alpha filterscope data (~9.6 MB,
> about 1.4 s) to confirm the channels exist and show you the trace, but I
> cannot produce ELM labels here: GA's detector is not installed in this image.
> Shall I fetch it?

**This applies to ranges too, not just single shots.** "Which shots in
190000-195000 have channel X" is answered over the shots the index has checked,
and the rest are unknown. Say how many shots the range actually contains (query
d3drdb -- do not count shot numbers), how many were checked, and what completing
it would cost:

```python
from d3d_relational_db import plasma_shots_in_range
rng = plasma_shots_in_range(190000, 195000)     # 3507 real shots, not 5001 numbers
est = fetch_estimate(rng)
# would_fetch 3487 shots -> ~33.5 GB, ~4952 s
```

When the estimate is large, still give it -- "completing this range means ~33 GB
and about 80 minutes" lets the user decide, and a narrower sub-range is often
the sensible counter-offer. Silence about the cost is worse than a big number.

The shot number above is only an illustration. **Always check the actual index
with `is_indexed()` before saying a shot is or is not covered** -- this document
is not a list of which shots are indexed, and it goes stale as the index grows.

To actually perform the fetch once the user says yes, use `d3d-filterscopes`.

### Signal availability, independent of any detector

```python
signal_availability(shot=149058)
# 4 rows, e.g. {'shot': 149058, 'signal': 'fs04da', 'present': 1,
#   'n_samples': 300000, 't_start': 0.02, 't_end': 6000.0,   # <- MILLISECONDS
#   'rate_khz': 50.0, 'units': 'ph/cm2/sr/s', 'error': None}
#
# t_start/t_end are ms: this channel spans 0.02 ms to 6000 ms = 6 seconds.
# `units` describes the DATA (photon flux), not the time axis.

signal_availability(present=0, limit=2)
# {'shot': 55102, 'signal': 'fs03da', 'present': 0, ..., 'error': 'TreeFOPENR'}
```

`present=1` is not the same as *usable*: a channel can be present as a single
sample at t=0, or at 0.5-1 kHz which is far too slow to resolve ELMs. Check
`n_samples` and `rate_khz`, not just `present`.

**`rate_khz` is measured, not nominal, so bin it with care.** Values arrive in
near-duplicate pairs -- 50.0 *and* 49.951, 100.0 *and* 99.902, 10.0 *and*
9.996 -- because the rate is derived from the median sample spacing. Two
consequences:

- Grouping by the exact value fragments every nominal rate into two rows.
- Rounding to the nearest integer merges 0.5 kHz into the 1 kHz bin, because
  SQLite rounds 0.5 up.

Bin with an explicit tolerance instead, and **never present a rounded bin
alongside its own constituents** -- a table listing both "~1 kHz: 256" and
"0.5 kHz: 198" double-counts the 198. This has already reached a reviewer.

```python
shots_with_signals(['fs04da', 'fs03da'], 190000, 195000)
# {'have': [190067, 190300, ...],      # 20 shots
#  'missing': [],
#  'not_indexed_note': '20 shots in this range have been checked. Any shot in
#   the range not listed in either group has never been fetched, and its
#   availability is unknown -- not absent.'}
```

Always pass on that note when answering a range question -- the honest answer
distinguishes "checked and absent" from "never checked".

### Where in the archive the index has data

```python
coverage_summary()
# [{'bucket': 50000, 'shots_indexed': 13, 'usable': 0, 'labeled': 0},
#  ...
#  {'bucket': 130000, 'shots_indexed': 34, 'usable': 30, 'labeled': 30}, ...]
```

### Detector provenance and method comparison

```python
runs()
# run_id, method, method_version, granularity, parameters (JSON),
# source_repo, source_commit, signal_candidates, created_at, is_default, notes

cmp = compare_runs(1, 2, shot=149058)
# cmp['comparable'] -> False
# cmp['granularity_warning'] -> "run 1 is 'interval' and run 2 is 'burst' --
#     these are different products. Counts are not comparable..."
# cmp['per_shot'] -> [{'shot': 149058, 'n_a': 2, 'n_b': 82}]
```

To read a run's parameters, parse the JSON:

```python
import json
json.loads(runs()[0]["parameters"])["elm_merge_time"]   # 200.0
```

## Anything else: raw SQL

```python
schema()   # prints every table, column and row count

query_elm_index("""
    SELECT s.shot, s.signal_used, COUNT(l.label_id) n
    FROM elm_run_shots s LEFT JOIN elm_labels l
      ON l.run_id = s.run_id AND l.shot = s.shot
    WHERE s.run_id = 1 AND s.status = 'labeled'
    GROUP BY s.shot HAVING n > 3 ORDER BY n DESC LIMIT 5
""")
```

Tables: `elm_runs`, `elm_run_shots`, `elm_labels`, `signal_availability`, and
the view `elm_labels_current` (labels from the default run only).

**SQL trap:** `elm_run_shots` has one row per (run, shot). Joining
`elm_labels` to it without constraining `run_id` on *both* sides counts every
label once per run and silently doubles the totals.

## Joining to d3drdb

Physics context lives in the other database. Attach it rather than
re-implementing lookups -- and prefer the `d3d-relational-db` skill for
anything that is purely a d3drdb question.

```python
import sqlite3
from d3d_elm_index import locate_elm_db
import sys, os
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.expanduser("~/.deepagents/agent/skills/d3d-relational-db"))
from d3d_relational_db import locate_d3drdb

con = sqlite3.connect(f"file:{locate_elm_db()}?mode=ro", uri=True)
con.execute(f"ATTACH DATABASE 'file:{locate_d3drdb()}?mode=ro' AS d3d")
rows = con.execute("""
    SELECT l.shot, COUNT(*) n_windows,
           ROUND(SUM(l.end_time - l.start_time)) elmy_ms,
           ROUND(m.ipmax/1e6, 2) ip_MA, ROUND(m.kappa, 2) kappa
    FROM elm_labels_current l
    JOIN d3d.SUMMARIES m ON m.shot = l.shot
    GROUP BY l.shot ORDER BY elmy_ms DESC LIMIT 5
""").fetchall()
```

`d3d.SUMMARIES` also has `t_ip_flat` and `ip_flat_duration` (flattop timing),
which lets an ELM window be placed within the discharge phase.

If `locate_d3drdb()` returns None the d3drdb file is not installed; answer the
ELM-only part and say the physics join is unavailable rather than guessing.

## Reporting rules

1. State how many shots the answer is based on, and that the index is a
   subset. "234 of the 820 indexed shots" -- never "234 DIII-D shots".
2. Give `signal_used` when the answer depends on which diagnostic was read.
3. Give the granularity and, for interval results, the merge time -- the
   parameters change what a row means.
4. Never present a derived rate without its basis (bursts over what duration).
5. If a question needs a label class not in `label_classes`, say the detector
   does not produce it. Do not substitute a different class.
6. Label every time column `ms` (Rule 7).
7. **Quote numbers from query output, not from memory.** When giving a worked
   example or a "sample row", copy it from what the script actually printed. A
   plausible-looking value written from recollection is the failure mode that
   survives review, because everything around it is correct.
8. When a question is about a shot RANGE, get the population size by querying
   d3drdb rather than assuming -- the count of shot *numbers* in the interval
   is not the count of shots that exist.
